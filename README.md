# 💶 EuroCalc

**EuroCalc** is a lightweight **offline calculator app** (wrapped as an Android APK) that helps calculate **change in Euro** when payment is made in a mix of **Bulgarian Leva (BGN)** and **EUR**.  
Ideal for waiters, bartenders, or shopkeepers who will handle both currencies during **Bulgaria’s Euro changeover in January 2026**.

## ❗ Why EuroCalc?

Starting **1 January 2026**, **Bulgaria will officially adopt the Euro (€)** as its national currency, replacing the **Bulgarian Lev (BGN)**.  
According to the official **Law on the Introduction of the Euro in the Republic of Bulgaria**:

> “During the dual circulation period, lasting **1 month** after the euro adoption date, payments may be made in both euro and leva. Change must be returned **in euro only**, even if the customer pays in BGN.”

🔁 **EuroCalc helps retailers handle this transition smoothly** by automatically converting mixed payments and calculating the exact change in euros.

### 🧮 Rounding Rules

As required by law:

> “The final amount payable in euro shall be rounded to **the nearest euro cent**. Amounts ending in 0.5 cents or more are rounded **up**, and amounts below 0.5 cents are rounded **down**.”

✅ **EuroCalc automatically applies these rounding rules** to ensure full legal compliance during transactions.
